        <h2>What is itercare?</h2>
        <p>iTera Care is a revolutionary, non-invasive way to reduce discomfort and promote and accelerate health. This system promotes scalar energy utilizing quartz crystals. Because of the terahertz frequencies, it helps the body get rid of bad cells and forms new healthy cells while also detoxifying and cleansing the body.

            IteraCare uses Terahertz technology which is an electromagnetic frquency that can deeply penetrate the body anywhere from 20 - 30cm deep. This allows it to reach bone marrow, improving blood circulation and strengthening the immune system. This helps to repair damaged cells, improve healing times, and leaves you feeling energized.</p>

        <h2>What is itercare structured water?</h2>
        <p>Using the iTeraCare device to 'wand' your water creates what we call, structured water. Structured water refers to a special kind of water that has been treated using various technologies to make its molecules more organized. These technologies can include things like spinning the water in a vortex, using magnets, or even exposing it to sunlight or crystals. The iTeraCare TeraHerz device uses terahertz waves to break down water molecules into smaller, linear particles. This process helps our bodies absorb the water more easily, leading to better hydration and overall health. Structured water is thought to have many health benefits, such as improving digestion and absorption of nutrients, reducing inflammation, and helping with detoxification.</p>
        
        <h2>Why drink structred water?</h2>
        <p>The regular consumption of Terahertz Water offers several health benefits, including enhancing human cell activity, reducing blood viscosity, eliminating waste and toxins, and repairing cells to promote overall health and vitality. Terahertz Water contains single water molecules that can easily pass through cell membrane water channels due to their kinetic energy, fast movement speed, high penetration force, and strong dissolving power.
        </p>
        <p>  
        Once inside the body, Terahertz Water resonates with the cells, delivering essential nutrients, minerals, and oxygen throughout the body. This nourishing liquid fills every cell, promoting cell growth and development and increasing cellular activity. Additionally, Terahertz Water aids in moisturizing the skin, contributing to its beauty and vitality.
        </p>
        <p>   
        Furthermore, Terahertz Water helps to dissolve and excrete nutrients that may not be fully absorbed by cells, as well as fats, cholesterol, and other substances stored in the body. This improves the body's detoxification capabilities and supports overall wellness.
            
        Overall, Terahertz Water offers a holistic approach to health and well-being, providing essential hydration and promoting cellular health andÂ detoxification.
